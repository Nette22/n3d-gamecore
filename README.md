# n3d-gamecore (0.0.0-alpha1)

checkout the 'dev' branch for the most recent build, the codebase is considered
**ALPHA quality** only, should be OK to use but is 'unstable' because the API
will probably change without notice. If you pull updates from 'dev' branch and
it breaks your code, its on you, thats your warning. _Use at own risk_.


##3D WebGL Multi-Player Game Engine (Node.js / Three.js / HTML5)
Node.js websockets application that provides core functionality of a 3D multi-player
game engine, most of  the original 2D code remains, it has been re-purposed to
provide the player mini-map overhead view, the client and server messaging subsystem
implements client prediction and responds to client input with authoritative
server update packets using socket.io (Express is included but its only doing basic
routing to serve the 'public/' folder files at the moment) and all of the 3D scene
rendering in the browser is provided by Three.js, all connected clients will need
to be running a modern WebGL/HTML5 compatible browser (such as Chrome or Firefox)

This is **not** a fully functional game, it is intended to be a scalable realtime
massively multi-player component to incorporate into your game project, my goal is to
support up to 512k concurrent connections (at a future stage of the project). The
concept will be to keep this core component as lean and efficient as possible
without adding many additional features (i.e. sophisticated collision physics) but
to also include a stable API so that those extra features can easily be provided by
other Node.js modules.
